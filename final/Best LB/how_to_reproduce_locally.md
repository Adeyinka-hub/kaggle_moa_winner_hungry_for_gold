# How to Reproduce Winning Solution Locally

This documentation provides the steps of training, inferencing and blending to reproduce our winning solution.

## Local Setup

Install required dependency libraries first.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It is recommended to run training and inference on a local machine with at least 4 CPUs, 16GB Host Memory and 11GB GPU Memory (Nvidia 2080-Ti or better GPU).


## Training Single Models

### 3-Stage NN


### 2-Stage NN+TabNet


### Simple NN with Old CV


### Simple NN with New CV


### 2-heads ResNet


### DeepInsight EfficientNet B3 Noisy Student


### DeepInsight ResNeSt V2



## Run Inference on Single Models


### 3-Stage NN


### 2-Stage NN+TabNet


### Simple NN with Old CV


### Simple NN with New CV


### 2-heads ResNet


### DeepInsight EfficientNet B3 Noisy Student


### DeepInsight ResNeSt V2
